# Podium's UI/UX Business Needs
Podium needs you to take the lead on the front-end UI/UX of our consumer-facing community app, and so we need the following:
* Optimistic UI design strategy
* Responsive Android and iOS UI implementation
* Pixel perfect visuals that are elegant and pleasing to the eye
* Fast page loading and caching strategy which ensure deeplinks are serviced rapidly
* Ability to work effectively in shared source code repo (using feature branches and pull requests)


# Podium App Demonstration Task
The goal of this task is to assess your ability to meet Podium's business needs, as our UI/UX Development Lead.

We have provided a list of deliverables which you can use to demonstrate how you meet Podium's needs. You can implement any number of these deliverables. 

## Notes
* Provide your effort to this repository via a pull request from your own feature branch.
* You will find all resources for the deliverables provided in the `/visual-designs` directory of this repository.
* This task allows you to demonstrate your front-end UI building skills and knowledge, there is absolutely no requirement for any data to be real. **All** data items, and user-login authentication can be served from a faked provider-service.
* It is not 100% required that your demonstation app be written using Angular.  If you feel you can achieve a more impressive result using React then please do so. The resulting code you commit to this repository **must** produce, at least, a valid Android Studio **or** iOS XCode project which runs in its default simulator.


# Deliverables

## Primary
* Podium 'Engage' feed

## Secondary
* Application startup splash screen ending in a welcome-page screen if no current authenticated user

* A 'styleguide' page, accessible only by authenticated users
